Simple react template with react, webpack and babel
===
The main goal of this repository is practicing setting up a react app from scratch without using the create-react-app, simply to learn about webpack and babel.

Instead of doing that you could eject create-react-app itself or another option that I found very useful and well explained by Manorisms in this video:   
[Forking instead of Ejecting a Create React App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I22TW-33dDE) 

Other useful tutorials for building your own react-template that I used are:

[Deconstructing Create-React-App with Webpack 4 & Babel 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4swyDR45SY) - By Code Realm

Other than that create-react-app is awesome so use it, this repository is simply for learning purposes.
